# Covid-19 Twitter Sentiement Analysis Project README


This Python script is a versatile tool for performing sentiment analysis on a collection of tweets obtained from Twitter.
It combines the power of several essential libraries and modules to gather, clean, and analyze Twitter data that contain
specific keywords, within specified locations. The scraped tweets are then analysed using the TextBlob sentiment analysis
library, where their polarity scorces and subjectivity scores are then returned.
